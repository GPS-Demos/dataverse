    <h1>About the Google Public Sector (GPS) Dataverse</h1>
    <p>Google Public Sector is committed to benefiting society. We believe that open data can be used to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, such as climate change, poverty, and disease. By providing a secure and reliable platform for hosting data, we can help public sector organizations and researchers share their data with the world, and make it easier for people to use that data to make a difference.</p>

    <h2>About the Data Commons project</h2>
    <p>Publicly available data from open sources are vital resources for students and researchers in a variety of disciplines. Unfortunately, processing these data sets is often tedious and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying data sets. Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities and resolving different types of keys and identifiers. This process is time consuming, tedious, and requires constant iteration. Data Commons addresses these problems by synthesizing a single graph from these different data sources. Data Commons links references to the same entities across different data sets to nodes on the graph, so that users can access data about a particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining.</p>

    <h2>Who can use it?</h2>
    <p>GPS Dataverse can be accessed by anyone via the tools available on <a href="/">gpsdataverse.com</a>. Students, researchers, and developers can use the REST, Python, and Google Sheets APIs, all of which are free for educational, academic, and journalistic research purposes.</p>
